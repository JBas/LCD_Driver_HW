# LCD Driver (HW Implementation)

Welcome to the project repository for my implementation of the driver board for the LD070WS2 LCD display!
This display was used in the Nook Color, an e-reader I enjoyed using - and taking apart.

I am undertaking this project for several reasons:
Firstly, I want to salvage a part of an otherwise obselete device (in my opinion. I also didn't feel like rooting it and having it be another Android machine). In my preliminary research, I did not find any sort of project or product that facilitated the use of this display as a general purpose LCD. (Please let me know if this has been done before, it might just save me time and be helpful!)
Secondly, I want to refresh my SystemVerilog skills and explore a more-or-less "real world" application of these skills, away from the convenient restrictions of a classroom.

## Goals

In mostly prioritized order:

* Research
  * gather all necessary datasheets and upload to repo if possible
* Subdivide functional requirements as seen from datasheets
    * priortize LCD over capacitative touch
* Create testbenches for each functional requirement
  * make sure these make sense
* Write actual SystemVerilog code for the functional requirements
* Test using testbenches
  * modifiy testbenches/code as needed
* Hopefully it works :]
